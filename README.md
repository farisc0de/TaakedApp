Crowd Management App - Capstone Project

## Abstract

Crowd management is a public practice where large crowds are managed. It used to ensure the control of gatherings and crowded places. The goal of that process is to facilitate the movement between places, reduce risks, prevent disasters, and the correct flow of movement and traffic. Malls and public places are constantly considered as crowded places, sometimes there are visitors with a number greater than the capacity of the place, which leads to overcrowding and congestions, and this causes them to be prevented from entering or unwanted waiting and loss of time. In the literature review, there are some studies and systems that have discussed crowd management in distinct and intelligent ways. However, we have found that their studies do work to know the peak times but do not provide suggestions to users for similar places. This project provides a solution for showing crowds in a form of mobile application. The solution would use historical data to provide suggestions to visitors and identify the peak times in public places and to facilitate access to these places, it would also help in reducing overcrowding and
